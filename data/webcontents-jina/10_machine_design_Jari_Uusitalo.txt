_**Group project:**  
\- design a machine (mechanism+actuation+automation), including the end effector - build the passive parts and operate it manually - document the group project and your individual contribution

My task for this week was to build laser cutting images with Inkscape, using Ari's 3D model as basis. I imported the model, and used measuring tool for dimensions.

On Inkscape, I installed [Tabbed Box Maker](https://github.com/paulh-rnd/TabbedBoxMaker) extension, by simply copying the files to inkscape/shares/extensions folder.

Under extension, laser tools, selected tabbed box maker.From opening windows I could select dimensions, tab width, kerf, joint clearance etc.

The extension could only help me out so far, and had to manually split boxes to make the design as I wanted. Measuring the 3d model and then applying values to inkscape. After everything was done, I placed them so we could cut this in 1 go.
