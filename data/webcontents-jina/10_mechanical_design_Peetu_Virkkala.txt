Topic: Mechanical design
------------------------

Goals of this week:  

*   Design a machine that includes mechanism+actuation+automation (Group) ([LINK](http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/machine_week_group2.html))  
    
*   Build the passive parts and operate it manually (Group) ([LINK](http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/machine_week_group2.html))
*   Document the group project and your individual contribution (Group) ([LINK](http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/machine_week_group2.html))

There were no individual assignments for this week so here you can find my individual contribution for this week´s machine project  

Brainstorming the idea
----------------------

Our lab divided into two groups. Our group decided to create automatic apple peeling device. Before going any further, we researched more  
about the device. I found following examples:  
![Image 1: apples](https://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/students/peetu-virkkala/images/Week15-MechanicalDesign/Apples.jpg)When we had more information about the possibilities, we had a brainstorming session for machine designing:

First, we visualized how the machine could work:

Then we imagined the apple peeling procedure from the start to finish:

According to our findings, I created two sketches about our machine:

After this sketching session, we divided responsibility and began to create the machine.

Creating a dish
---------------

When the machine peels the apple, apple peels drop on the top of the machine. To protect the machine from the peels, I decided to create  
a simple waterproof dish. First I tried to create the dish from a yellow 3mm vinyl plate:  
![Image 7: plastic](https://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/students/peetu-virkkala/images/Week15-MechanicalDesign/Plastic.jpg)However, it was difficult to glue the pieces together so I decided to do same design with an mdf-pieces and cover them with an epoxy layer.  
First I printed the pieces and glued them together with a paper glue:  
![Image 8: Mdf](https://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/students/peetu-virkkala/images/Week15-MechanicalDesign/Mdf.jpg)

Then I mixed an epoxy liquid and covered the glued piece with it:  
![Image 9: Epox](https://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/students/peetu-virkkala/images/Week15-MechanicalDesign/Epox.jpg)

Next morning, epox had dried out and the dish was ready to be used:

Building a base for a stepper motor
-----------------------------------

I built a durable container for a stepper motor inside of a cardboard box. First I used super strong tape to attach the motor to box. Then  
I created cardboard dividers and attached them to box. Finally, I filled all empty spots with a wool and covered the box with a masking tape.  
The box was now ready to be used:

Creating a pitchfork
--------------------

Next, I began to create a pitchfork which is used to pierce an apple. To do this, I acquired a sausage stick and measured its width with  
a micrometer screw:  
![Image 12: Atrain](https://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/students/peetu-virkkala/images/Week15-MechanicalDesign/Atrain.jpg)Next, our team 3D printed a clutch according to width measurements which we got from the sausage stick and the stepper motor. When the clutch  
was ready, I cut the sausage stick with an iron saw and attached the piece to the clutch. To tight the bond between the pieces, I used a piece of  
wool to wedge the pieces together.
