The idea behind the machine :
-----------------------------

*   We have chosen to make this machine because its not available in the lab also because it can make easy and beautiful 3D,2D parts

Arduino CNC Machine Foam Cutting Mechanical part :
--------------------------------------------------

In this week we worked on a CNC Foam Cutting Machine, with 3-axis, where the machine moves in two axis forward and backward, and rotate around the Z-axis.

![Image 1: degrees_of_freedom](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/degrees_of_freedom.png)

This machine can cut 2D shapes, as well as 2.5D shapes or 3D symmetrical shapes.

Arduino CNC Foam Cutting Machine :
----------------------------------

We based our design on [Arduino CNC Foam Cutting Machine](https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/arduino-cnc-foam-cutting-machine/), because the machine uses _aluminum extrusion profiles 2020_ easier to assemble, also reduces the time building the machine because of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.

And made some upgrades on the machine rail system to be more rigid, where the new design has one more rail on each side and the 3D files were changed also to be adjusted to the new design.

### **Original design !!** :

> Overall, in terms of construction and rigidity the design is probably not that good, but In my opinion making a function machine with minimum parts possible and still to be able to get the job done.

![Image 2: Original design](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/Orginal_ver.jpg)

### **Modified design !!**:

In this design we wanted the machine to be more rigid so we have made those changes :

*   First we have added one more linear rail for each moving axis in each side .
    
*   Second we have edited the 3D models in order to fit the new design .
    
*   Third we have used a flexible Coupler instead of the shaft Coupler _(printed one)_ .
    
*   Finally we have replaced the linear rod from 10mm to 8mm and the bearings also .
    
*   And you can see the changes we have made in the picture below, _the red parts !!_ .

Challenges :
------------

We have faced some challenges while making this machine and here is a list of what we have faced :

*   The main problem we have faced is that the store we have ordered the pieces from got delayed to reach us because of the lockdown, also we have received some parts that were not as we ordered which caused a lot of missing time and delayed us even more in remodifying the mechanical pieces .
    
*   Also there were some pieces that we could not find in stores so we designed those parts and 3D printed them, _However we know that 3D printing those partswas not the best solution_ .
    

Arduino CNC Machine Electronics part :
--------------------------------------

In this part we will build Arduino CNC Foam Cutting Machine. The machine is inspired by the work found [here](https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/arduino-cnc-foam-cutting-machine/).

This is a team working task and different students will be working on different parts. My part and my colleague Aziz is to work on electronics and softwares, including drivers, boards, motors, hot wire and control programs.

*   The Arduino Uno is where the GRBL will be installed and will control the machine.
    
    ![Image 4](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics2.jpg)
    
*   DRV8825 drivers will control the steppers which provide motion.
    
    ![Image 5](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics3.jpg)
    
*   Arduino CNC shield interfaces DRV8825 drivers to Arduino board.
    
    ![Image 6](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics4.jpg)
    
*   DC-DC converter will control the temperature of the hot wire

*   Limit switches will define the zero or home position of +X and +Y axes.
    
    ![Image 8](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics06.jpg)
    
*   Hot wire will heat cut the foam. Hot wire should maintain uniform temperature along its length when it heats up.
    
    ![Image 9](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics07.jpg)
    
*   And finally, the adaptor will supply power to the whole system.

### Circuit Diagram :

*   The image below shows how different components are connected to each other. Note how all components are interfaced to Arduino board using the CNC shield. This will make connected compact and easier to complete.

### Driver Resolution :

*   The DRV8825 driver can be set to drive stepper motors at different resolutions. The driver resolution selectors have 100 kOhm pull-down resistors, which makes them level LOW if there are left unconnected.
    
    ![Image 12](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics9.jpg)
    
*   The CNC shield has connections to resolution selectors and jumpers can be used to set the required resolution. A connected jumper will drive the selector pin (M0, M1, M2) to level high. The image below shows some examples for driver resolution for DRV8825. In our machine will use 1/16 stepper resolution.
    
    ![Image 13](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics10.jpg)
    

Arduino CNC machine Software :
------------------------------

*   Two programs will be used to control the machine. The first is GRBL firmware which will installed into Arduino board and enable it to understand g-codes, and the other is g-code sender that will be installed to PC and communicate with Arduino board and send g-codes.
    
    ![Image 14](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics11.jpg)
    

### GRBL Firmware :

GRBL is a firmware for Arduino board running on ATmega328P microprocessor. GRBL accepts g-code as inputs and generates outputs at Arduino board pins. Compared to industrial CNC machines, when GRBL is used there is no need for any ports to control the machine, only the USB port connected to Arduino board. In other words, when GRBL firmware is installed to Arduino board, it will read g-codes and control the machine accordingly. To know more about GRBL, check the [project page](https://github.com/gnea/grbl).

*   Step 1: Download GRBL firmware and extract it and copy the folder "grbl-master". Do not copy this folder to "Arduino library directory!"
    
    ![Image 15](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics12.jpg)
    
*   Step 2: In Arduino IDE go to "Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library..." and from inside "grbl-master" folder locate "grbl" folder. Click open.
    
    ![Image 16](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics13.jpg)
    
*   You should receive the message below.
    
    ![Image 17](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics14.jpg)
    
*   Step 3: Go to "File > Examples > grbl > grblUpload", select the Arduino board (UNO in our case) and the COM port, click upload.
    
    ![Image 18](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics15.jpg)
    
*   Note that the firmware used most of the board memory.
    
    ![Image 19](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics16.jpg)
    
*   Step 4: Open the "Serial Monitor" and set baud rate to 115200. You should see "Grbl 1.1h \['$' for help\] " in serial monitor. Type "$$" and send, settings list will appear. We will modify these settings to fit with our machine using the GRBL controller software or g-code sender.
    
*   Step 5: Since we don't have a Z-axis switch, we should define that in the config.h file of GRBL. Go to "Arduino library directory > grbl" and open config.h, then find the following parts
    

```
// NOTE: Defaults are set for a traditional 3-axis CNC machine. Z-axis first to clear, followed by X & Y.
#define HOMING_CYCLE_0 (1<<Z_AXIS)                // REQUIRED: First move Z to clear workspace.
#define HOMING_CYCLE_1 ((1<<X_AXIS)|(1<<Y_AXIS))  // OPTIONAL: Then move X,Y at the same time.
// #define HOMING_CYCLE_2                         // OPTIONAL: Uncomment and add axes mask to enable

// NOTE: The following are two examples to setup homing for 2-axis machines.
// #define HOMING_CYCLE_0 ((1<<X_AXIS)|(1<<Y_AXIS))  // NOT COMPATIBLE WITH COREXY: Homes both X-Y in one cycle.

// #define HOMING_CYCLE_0 (1<<X_AXIS)  // COREXY COMPATIBLE: First home X
// #define HOMING_CYCLE_1 (1<<Y_AXIS)  // COREXY COMPATIBLE: Then home Y
```

and change it to

```
// NOTE: Defaults are set for a traditional 3-axis CNC machine. Z-axis first to clear, followed by X & Y.
//#define HOMING_CYCLE_0 (1<<Z_AXIS)                // REQUIRED: First move Z to clear workspace.
//#define HOMING_CYCLE_1 ((1<<X_AXIS)|(1<<Y_AXIS))  // OPTIONAL: Then move X,Y at the same time.
// #define HOMING_CYCLE_2                         // OPTIONAL: Uncomment and add axes mask to enable

// NOTE: The following are two examples to setup homing for 2-axis machines.
// #define HOMING_CYCLE_0 ((1<<X_AXIS)|(1<<Y_AXIS))  // NOT COMPATIBLE WITH COREXY: Homes both X-Y in one cycle.

#define HOMING_CYCLE_0 (1<<X_AXIS)  // COREXY COMPATIBLE: First home X
#define HOMING_CYCLE_1 (1<<Y_AXIS)  // COREXY COMPATIBLE: Then home Y
```

*   Save the file and reupload the "grblUpload" sketch to our Arduino board.

### GRBL Controller Software (g-code Sender) :

This software will generate g-codes according to job and send those codes to Arduino board (which knows how to read g-codes now!). We will use [Universal G-code Sender](https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/).

*   Step 1: Install JAVA Runtime Environment to your PC from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html). The GRBL controller is a JAVA program and runtime environment should be installed. You may need to create an account.
    
*   Step 2: Go to [download page](https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/download/) and download 2.0 Platform version and extract the zip file. Inside extracted file open "ugsplatfrom > bin" and run one of the executable files (ugsplatform64 in my case).
    
    ![Image 20](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics17.jpg)
    
*   Step 3: Connect to Arduino board. Set baud rate to 115200 and the right COM port. Click on "Connect/Disconnect" button. In the console window you should see connection confirmation and defined settings.
    
    ![Image 21](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics18.jpg)
    
*   Step 4: To configure the machine, we will use the built in setup wizard. Go to "Machine > Setup wizard...". A new window will appear, which will confirm connection to GRBL.
    
    ![Image 22](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics19.jpg)
    

Testing System Component :
--------------------------

### Steppers and Limit Switches :

*   We tested system components before assembly to the mechanical part of the machine.
    
*   First we connected the CNC shield to Arduino board and put a jumper to M2 pins for each axis (1/16 resolution), then connected the DRV8825 stepper driver.
    
    ![Image 23](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics20.jpg)
    
*   Then we connected stepper motors, limit switches for +X and +Y axes, powered the shield with +12 VDC and connected Arduino USB cable.
    
    ![Image 24](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics21.jpg)
    
*   To test steppers and limit switches, we used the g-code sender. We ran the setup wizard and connected to GRBL in Arduino. In "Motor wiring", we tested the operation for each stepper and tried to reverse direction.
    
    ![Image 25](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/images/week18/electronics22.jpg)
    
*   And we used the "Limit switches" section to test +X and +Y home switches. First limit switches were enabled. Note that the Z axis is rotational and has no home position. In hardware we have normally closed switches. In normal position when the switches are not actuated the switch box will be in green, and should turn into red when the switch is actuated. "Invert limit switches" checkbox is checked to achieve this.
    
    ![Image 26](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics23.jpg)
    

### Hot wire :

*   First we tested the hot wire using the DC-DC stepdown converter. We tried the hot wire at different voltages. The maximum output we could achieve from the converter was 8.17 VDC, and was not enough to have a good cut.
    
    ![Image 27](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics24.jpg)
    

*   Then we connected the hot wire to +12 VDC, and removed the converter from the system and directly connected the hot wire to system power adapter. Cutting results were better and acceptable.
    
    ![Image 28](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/electronics25.jpg)
    

Hero Shoot for Machine Electronics part :
-----------------------------------------

*   This video shows steppers testing. The X-axis stepper was rotating in reverse direction compared to Y and Z axes steppers. We reversed the rotation of X-axis stepper using the g-code sender.

*   This video shows limit switches. When actuated, switches colors turn into red in g-code sender programs. We inverted switches since we are using NC ones.

*   This video shows the hot wire cutting test using +12 VDC.

Arduino CNC Machine Foam Cutting Designing part :
-------------------------------------------------

*   then tried to modify Shaft clamp 10mm to fit the 2 parallel rods ad first prototype and printing it using same settings :
    
    ![Image 29](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/2a.jpg)
    
*   but sadly it was structurally not the best after trying the physical assembly so the design had been modified :
    
    ![Image 30](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/techworks/assets/img/machine/2b.jpg)
