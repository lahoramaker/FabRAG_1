First I remade the parts layout to reflect needed changes for the larger scale cnc cut puzzle. ![Image 5](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/dassault/students/daniel-smithwick/images/4x8layout.PNG)

I used ShopBot’s VCarve program to define the tool paths - all path were set to the Contour method.

Includes: I scaled overall 2x the original size. I added dog bone corners, and I made the parts 8X thicker so that they’d be more chunky at larger scale as opposed to planar.

2D Workflow[¶](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/dassault/students/daniel-smithwick/assignments/week08/#2d-workflow "Permanent link")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here’s a Rhino screenshot to illustrate a 2d workflow for modifying the red geometry to be ready for milling, the black geometry. ![Image 6](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/dassault/students/daniel-smithwick/images/fillets2.png)

The main 2D drafting operations I used were fillet, offset, move, rotate, and join. By using thicker material I need to offset the lines to make the gap wider. I also need to account interior corners when using press fit/slotted geometry, hence the dogbone geometry. This particular dogbone geometry uses a double fillet so to prevent any sharp corners. When modifying this particular piece I had to remove a significant chunk of material from the bottom left corner By widening the slot, it left a really small pinch point in the material which would have likely broken off after cutting. So I made the decision to remove the geometry to the left of the slot, however I left some small nub to help hold the parts together.

![Image 7](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/dassault/students/daniel-smithwick/images/vcarve.jpg) I used Vcarve to generate the gcode for the piece. In this photo I’m selecting the 1/4” downcut tool, and making sure the feed and speed and rpm are appropriate for the material. I also can set the pass depth and stepover here. Since this is just a profile cut, I don’t need to worry about step over dimensions. However, in the [Casting and Molding Week](http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/dassault/students/daniel-smithwick/assignments/week10/), I did adjust these settings to get the precision of the slope.

![Image 8](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/dassault/students/daniel-smithwick/images/shopbot.jpg) Here is the Shopbot control interface. First, you need to manually jog the tool over to your 0,0. You do this with the blue Keypad arrows.

![Image 10](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/dassault/students/daniel-smithwick/images/shopbot1.jpg) The 1” foam cut quite well. I could probably speed up the feed rate.

I secured the parts to the table using wood screws.

![Image 11](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/dassault/students/daniel-smithwick/images/cncpartdetail.jpg) Here’s a detail of the dog bone design - a modified ‘H’ section. I’ve also added fillets to the all exterior corners to mimimize breakage.

![Image 12](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/dassault/students/daniel-smithwick/images/cncpart1test.jpg) Here’s the full piece! It’s about 30” tall, 1” thick.
