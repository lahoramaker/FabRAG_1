Markdown Content:
This week I learnt how to **duplicate shapes** and how to **print 3D objects**; I discovered, respectively, the rules to convert light points of shapes and to set 3D printer properly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using scanner machine and softwares I learnt how to duplicate shapes, catching light points and converting them in meshes.

### 3D systems Sense[¶](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/napoli/students/michele-serpico/assignments/week06/#3d-systems-sense "Permanent link")

I used the Sense scanner by 3D Systems to scan a 3D printed helmet: **1st** I clicked the space bar to start scanning and **2nd** moving and recording around it the Sense software catched and converted light points of the helmet. **3rd** Then I clicked again on the space bar to stop scanning. **4th** So I could edit those meshes deleting and smoothing points, and also encasing the whole model using “solidify”.

Then I uploaded and shared this .obj file on Sketchfab. I uploaded the files at the foot of the page.

### Recap[¶](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/napoli/students/michele-serpico/assignments/week06/#recap "Permanent link")

I also worked using Recap software; **1st** I installed on Recap and Recap Photos, and its others plug-in. **2nd** I uploaded photos and converted them automatically in meshes; It need at least 20 photos, and **3d** I selected the “auto-crop” mode.

**4th** Recap also save automatically the projects online in the specific cloud, where everyone can manage, edit and share projects.

3D Printing[¶](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/napoli/students/michele-serpico/assignments/week06/#3d-printing "Permanent link")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I learnt that 3D printers have to be set properly, in order to make high quality objects melting specific materials according to the points of modeled shapes.

### Modeling[¶](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/napoli/students/michele-serpico/assignments/week06/#modeling "Permanent link")

To print something, 3D printers have to be set with supported CAD files uploaded from wi-fi or SD micro-card.

Using Rhinoceros, I modeled and converted in meshes a case for the ISP-ATtiny45 I made.

I added also an hollow part to carry the ISP. This part can’t be made subtractively.

### Zortrax M200[¶](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/napoli/students/michele-serpico/assignments/week06/#zortrax-m200 "Permanent link")

I printed this case using a Zortrax M200; its extruder work moving along x and y axis, instead the plane moves up and down according to z axes. It has a printing area of 200x200x185 mm.

So I installed Zortrax software Z-Suite and opened it; **1st** I imported the model and **2nd** positioned the pieces closer to optimize printing time, selecting “auto-arrange”. **3rd** In red, I checked part of objects that need support, named “smart bridges”, and always in red also the parts that are too thin.

Then I started to set other necessary parameters. **4th** Z-Suite calculates the fan speed automatically, but I had to learn that: **5th** setting more numbers of melting layers and offset parameters means more quality of printing, so I reduce the layer thickness to 0.14 mm; **6th** the type and the density of the infill determinate the the interior resistance of printed objects; I set it about 30% **7th** enabling raft and setting it layers I could divide printed objects from the printing plane, with 6 layers more and density about 100%, to print and after to remove them properly. Then **8th** I saved and exported my file.

I could print without smart bridges support, and I could also choose the density and speed of the first layer(100%).

The plastic material to fuse I used is the ABS, with a diameter of 0.4 mm.

Material usage: 2.94m (7g)

### ISP-Attiny45 case[¶](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/napoli/students/michele-serpico/assignments/week06/#isp-attiny45-case "Permanent link")

At the end, I generated the print settings file to check the resume of parameters and I started printing.

![Image 14: 9](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/napoli/students/michele-serpico/images/6.3d.scanning.and.printing/9.jpeg)

I carefully removed the pieces from the plane and the case from the draft;

Then I removed deburrings heating them.

I uploaded on Sketchfab also the .stl file of this case.
