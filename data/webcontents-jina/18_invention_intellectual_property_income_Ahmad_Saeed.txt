Dissemination Plan

I wish I would be able to convert my final project into a product kit. It would still be open-source, but I'd like to have the exclusive credit for any commercial thing.  
  
I started exploring the lisences randomly till I found those two resources:

*   [https://choosealicense.com/licenses/](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/)
*   [https://creativecommons.org/choose/](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)

I decided I would use:  
[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)  
  
Using the mentioned lisence will make other users able to:

*   Copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
*   Remix, transform, and build upon the material

Under the following terms:

*   An appropriate credit must be given to the creator and the lisence
*   No commercial use for the material
*   Remixed versions must be distributed under the same license as the original

The creativecommons website also provided me with an HTML code that I can add to the pages:

                                    ```
