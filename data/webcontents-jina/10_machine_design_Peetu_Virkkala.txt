What I did this week
--------------------

During this week, I developed our peeler machine as follows:  

*   Lasercut and attached boxes for the motor
  
I used boxes py to create 3 boxes: 1 for motor and 2 for surface. Boxes were super precise so they attached well together when I hammered  
pieces together. I also lasercut mdf surface top of the cardboard surface to limit bending. I used wood glue and sticker pads to attach  
these pieces together. Finally, everything was attached to the cardboard surface:![Image 1: 3](https://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/students/peetu-virkkala/images/Week16-MachineDesign/motor_box_3.jpg)

*   Connected clutch with the motor
To connect the clutch with the motor, I used wool to stuck the motor inside and screws to hold it there. The end result was fine:![Image 4: 5](https://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/students/peetu-virkkala/images/Week16-MachineDesign/Kiinni.jpg)

*   Designed, cut and assembled peeler holder
  
Our plastic container had already 3.5mm diameter holes between 19mm engraved to it, so I created corresponding hole-pattern  
in Fusion 360. In total, it took me few tries to get kerf and the sizes correct, but in a end I came up with good design:![Image 5: 5](https://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/students/peetu-virkkala/images/Week16-MachineDesign/PeelerHolder.jpg)

I screwed the peeler holder to plastic part with bolts. The connection was durable:
