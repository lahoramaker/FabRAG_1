	<h2>Topic: Mechanical design</h2>
	Goals of this week:<br>
	<ul>
	  <li>Design a machine that includes mechanism+actuation+automation (Group) (<a href="http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/machine_week_group2.html">LINK</a>)<br></li>
	  <li>Build the passive parts and operate it manually (Group) (<a href="http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/machine_week_group2.html">LINK</a>)</li>
	  <li>Document the group project and your individual contribution (Group) (<a href="http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablaboulu/machine_week_group2.html">LINK</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	There were no individual assignments for this week so here you can find my individual contribution for this week´s machine project<br>
	<h2>Brainstorming the idea</h2>
	Our lab divided into two groups. Our group decided to create automatic apple peeling device. Before going any further, we researched more<br>
	about the device. I found following examples:<br>

	<br>
	When we had more information about the possibilities, we had a brainstorming session for machine designing:<br>

	<br>
	First, we visualized how the machine could work:<br>

	  height="450"><br>
	<br>
	Then we imagined the apple peeling procedure from the start to finish:<br>

   	<br>
   	According to our findings, I created two sketches about our machine:<br>

	<br>
	After this sketching session, we divided responsibility and began to create the machine.<br>
	<h2>Creating a dish</h2>
	When the machine peels the apple, apple peels drop on the top of the machine. To protect the machine from the peels, I decided to create<br>
	a simple waterproof dish. First I tried to create the dish from a yellow 3mm vinyl plate:<br>

	  height="400"><br>
	  <br>
	However, it was difficult to glue the pieces together so I decided to do same design with an mdf-pieces and cover them with an epoxy layer.<br>
	First I printed the pieces and glued them together with a paper glue:<br>

	  height="600"><br>
	<br>
	Then I mixed an epoxy liquid and covered the glued piece with it:<br>

	  height="600"><br>
	<br>  
 	Next morning, epox had dried out and the dish was ready to be used:<br>

 	<h2>Building a base for a stepper motor</h2>
 	I built a durable container for a stepper motor inside of a cardboard box. First I used super strong tape to attach the motor to box. Then<br>
 	I created cardboard dividers and attached them to box. Finally, I filled all empty spots with a wool and covered the box with a masking tape.<br>
 	The box was now ready to be used:<br>

 	<h2>Creating a pitchfork</h2>
 	Next, I began to create a pitchfork which is used to pierce an apple. To do this, I acquired a sausage stick and measured its width with<br>
 	a micrometer screw:<br>

	<br>
	Next, our team 3D printed a clutch according to width measurements which we got from the sausage stick and the stepper motor. When the clutch<br>
	was ready, I cut the sausage stick with an iron saw and attached the piece to the clutch. To tight the bond between the pieces, I used a piece of<br>
	wool to wedge the pieces together.<br>
