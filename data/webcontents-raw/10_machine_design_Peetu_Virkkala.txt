	<h2>What I did this week</h2>
	During this week, I developed our peeler machine as follows:<br>
	<ul>
    <li>Lasercut and attached boxes for the motor</li>
    <br>
    I used boxes py to create 3 boxes: 1 for motor and 2 for surface. Boxes were super precise so they attached well together when I hammered<br>
    pieces together. I also lasercut mdf surface top of the cardboard surface to limit bending. I used wood glue and sticker pads to attach<br>
    these pieces together. Finally, everything was attached to the cardboard surface:<br>

	<br>
	<br>
     <li>Connected clutch with the motor</li>
     To connect the clutch with the motor, I used wool to stuck the motor inside and screws to hold it there. The end result was fine:<br>

	 <br>
     <li>Designed, cut and assembled peeler holder </li>
     <br>
     Our plastic container had already 3.5mm diameter holes between 19mm engraved to it, so I created corresponding hole-pattern<br>
     in Fusion 360. In total, it took me few tries to get kerf and the sizes correct, but in a end I came up with good design:<br>

	 I screwed the peeler holder to plastic part with bolts. The connection was durable:<br>
