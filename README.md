# FabRAG_1

Welcome to the FabRAG_1 repository! This project covers Phase 1 of the FabRAG project, which aims to create a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using text extracted from selected Fab Academy web pages.

## About FabRAG

The FabRAG project is inspired by the Fab 1.0 to 5.0 analogy and is divided into five main phases, each building upon the previous to create an increasingly sophisticated and capable system.

### Phase 1: Basic RAG System

This repository focuses on Phase 1 of the FabRAG project. In this initial phase, we have created a foundational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the text extracted from selected Fab Academy web pages. This phase establishes the core functionality of information retrieval and response generation along with the distribution mechanism for the system.

## Implementation

For this phase, we have utilized the Nomic gpt4all solution, which is licensed under the MIT license.

## Getting Started

To set up and test the system, please follow the instructions provided in this repository. You'll find all the necessary data and setup instructions to get the basic RAG system [at the docs](docs/setup_instructions.md).

However, certain repositories and contents created by students use non-commercial licenses.

Special care has been taken to ensure that every single file includes the author in the file name, so when the file is displayed in the RAG interface, the author is properly attributed.

Future versions of this FabRAG system will determine the specific licensing of each individual content piece and provide appropriate attribution and licensing information. Until that moment, the default license for this project is the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0.

Note that providing these contents is also in the spirit of The Fab Charter, which states that "Designs and processes developed in fab labs can be protected and sold however an inventor chooses, but should remain available for individuals to use and learn from".

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the Fab Academy community and beyond. Whether you're a digital fabrication expert, a machine learning enthusiast, or a user experience designer, there are many ways to get involved and help shape the future of FabRAG.

## Support

FabRAG is an ongoing project, and this README will be updated as the project progresses through its various phases. Stay tuned for more exciting developments!
